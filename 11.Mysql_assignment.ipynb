    "# Structure: Relational databases with a fixed schema (predefined structure) organized in tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "# Data: Structured data (tabular format) like customer information, financial records, or inventory.\n",
    "# Access: Uses SQL, a standardized language, for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "# Strengths: Excellent for complex data relationships, ACID compliance (ensures data integrity), and well-suited for traditional business applications.\n",

    "# Access: Uses various query languages specific to each NoSQL database type.\n",
    "# Strengths: Highly scalable (adding more servers for massive datasets is easier), flexible for diverse data formats, and good for big data applications.\n",
