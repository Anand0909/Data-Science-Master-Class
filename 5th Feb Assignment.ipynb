    "# Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, thereby inheriting its properties and behaviors.\n",

    "# There are four types of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a child class inherits properties and behaviors from a single parent class.\n",
    "# For example, consider a class hierarchy where \"Vehicle\" is the parent class, and \"Car\" is the child class. In this case, \n",
    "# the Car class inherits properties and behaviors from the Vehicle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a child class inherits properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes. \n",
    "# For example, consider a class hierarchy where \"Animal\" and \"Machine\" are two parent classes, and \"Robot\" is the child class. \n",
    "# In this case, the Robot class inherits properties and behaviors from both the Animal and Machine classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multi-level inheritance: In multi-level inheritance, a child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class,\n",
    "# which in turn inherits properties and behaviors from its own parent class. \n",
    "# For example, consider a class hierarchy where \"Animal\" is the parent class, \"Mammal\" is the child class, and \"Dog\" is the grandchild class. \n",
    "# In this case, the Dog class inherits properties and behaviors from both the Animal and Mammal classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hierarchical inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit properties and behaviors from a single parent class. \n",
    "# For example, consider a class hierarchy where \"Shape\" is the parent class, and \"Square\" and \"Rectangle\" are child classes. \n",
    "# In this case, both the Square and Rectangle classes inherit properties and behaviors from the Shape class.\n",

    "# Overall, inheritance is a powerful concept that allows for code reuse and promotes modular, extensible code design. \"\"\""
