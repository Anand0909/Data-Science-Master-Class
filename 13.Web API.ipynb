    "# Lightweight: REST uses lightweight messages (often JSON or XML) for data exchange, making it faster and more efficient.\n",

    "# Verbosity: SOAP messages are bulky due to their XML structure, leading to slower performance and increased bandwidth usage.\n",

    "# Less Readable: SOAP messages are less human-readable compared to the simpler JSON format commonly used in REST.\n",
    "# Limited Platform Support: While SOAP is protocol-agnostic, it's primarily used with HTTP, restricting its reach compared to REST's flexibility.\n",
    "# Steeper Learning Curve: Understanding and working with SOAP requires a deeper grasp of the protocol and its specifications compared to REST.\n",
